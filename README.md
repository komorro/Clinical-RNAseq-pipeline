# TARGET II data analysis

This project is an analysis of a bulk RNAseq of samples collected from acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients' bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) as a part of a uncdisclosed clinical trial.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** As the original analysis is still unpublished, this is an anonymized version of it, serving solely as an example pipeline of RNAseq data analysis.

The goal of the original analysis was to find gene expression patterns allowing for identification of certain clinical characteristic, including risk stratification at diagnosis.

Original BAM files are confidential, the starting point of this analysis are raw aligned counts. Due to non-public character of the original analysis, gene names and some of the clinical characteristics' names and categories were encrypted.
